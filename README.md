# DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO

## Supplier Quality and Performance Insight Project

#### Tools: Power Bi (Power Query, Data Source Integration, Data modelling, Calendar Table, Parameters, DAX, Visuallization tools, Bookmarks and Power BI Service publishing).

#### Project Background
Enterprise Manufacturer Ltd is a raw materials manufacturer facing quality inconsistencies across its supply chain, leading to production downtime and material defects. The company operates without a formal procurement system, and its vendor management processes have not effectively addressed quality issues. As a result, production inefficiencies have escalated, costing the company significant time and financial resources.

This project analysed 5,226 count rows of data from 2018 and 2019 to assess supplier quality and plant performance. Key objectives were to identify underperforming vendors and materials, analyse downtime impacts, and provide actionable insights for process improvements. The final deliverable included an interactive PowerBI dashboard for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:
    
- Vendor Performance: An assessment of suppliers responsible for material defects and downtime.
- Plant-Level Analysis: Evaluation of plant performance concerning downtime and defects.
- Material Performance: Insights into materials that contributed to production inefficiencies.
- Vendor-Material Relationship: Identification of underperforming vendor-material combinations impacting overall efficiency.

#### Tools: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Table, Conditional Formatting, Pivot Chart, Power Query Editor, Advanced Excel Formulas), SQL (DDL, DML, DXL)

#### Introduction

Unique Attireis is a small to medium-sized fashion enterprise well-known for its bespoke two-piece apparel. In January 2022, the company launched a new denim line, comprising 10 distinct types of pants and jackets. Unfortunately, the product line has fallen short of sales expectations, prompting the need for an in-depth analysis to guide strategic decisions.

#### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to assess the sales performance of the denim line and deliver actionable insights and recommendations to the Sales and Marketing teams. The project demonstrates the power of data-driven analysis in solving real-world business problems and guiding strategic decision-making.

## Customer Support Automation and Monitoring

#### Project Overview:
This project was executed during a 6-month sales campaign for **CloudFusion**, a SaaS company providing cloud-based services to businesses. The company contracted five customer support agents to manage the increasing number of support tickets during the campaign. My role as a **Data Analyst** was to automate the consolidation and monitoring of this data and provide real-time performance insights.

#### Project Objective:
The primary goal was to streamline and automate the reporting process for CloudFusion’s customer support operations. Key objectives included:

- Automating the consolidation of monthly support ticket data.
- Analysing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the number of tickets handled, resolution status, resolution time, and issue types.
- Designing a real-time dashboard to provide the management team with live insights into agent efficiency.
- Automating the creation of monthly reports for the campaign team’s review.
