# DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO

## [Supplier Quality and Performance Insight Project](/projects/supplier_quality/Power%20BI%20Supplier%20Insight%20Project.pbix)

#### Tools: Power BI (Power Query, Data Source Integration, Data modelling, Calendar Table, Parameters, DAX, Visualisation tools, Bookmarks and Power BI Service).

#### Project Background
Enterprise Manufacturer Ltd is a raw materials manufacturer facing quality inconsistencies across its supply chain, leading to production downtime and material defects. The company operates without a formal procurement system, and its vendor management processes have not effectively addressed quality issues. As a result, production inefficiencies have escalated, costing the company significant time and financial resources.

This project analysed 5,226 count rows of data from 2018 and 2019 to assess supplier quality and plant performance. Key objectives were to identify underperforming vendors and materials, analyse downtime impacts, and provide actionable insights for process improvements. The final deliverable included an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:
    
- Vendor Performance: An assessment of suppliers responsible for material defects and downtime.
- Plant-Level Analysis: Evaluation of plant performance concerning downtime and defects.
- Material Performance: Insights into materials that contributed to production inefficiencies.
- Vendor-Material Relationship: Identification of underperforming vendor-material combinations impacting overall efficiency.

## [Denim Product Line 2022 and 2023 Sales Report Project](/projects/denim/Denim_Product_Line_Sales_Report.xlsx)

#### Tools: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Table, Conditional Formatting, Pivot Chart, Power Query Editor, Advanced Excel Formulas), SQL (DDL, DML, DXL)

#### Introduction

Unique Attires is a small to medium-sized fashion enterprise well-known for its bespoke two-piece apparel. In January 2022, the company launched a new denim line, comprising 10 distinct types of pants and jackets. Unfortunately, the product line has fallen short of sales expectations, prompting the need for an in-depth analysis to guide strategic decisions.

#### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to assess the sales performance of the denim line and deliver actionable insights and recommendations to the Sales and Marketing teams.

#### The Dataset

The analysis leverages a dataset from Unique Attire's database, including sales data from 2022 to 2023. The various data points such as product sales figures, customer details, order specifics, and geographic distribution.

**North Star Metrics and Dimensions for Analysis**

- Total Sales: Represents the overall revenue generated from denim product sales, a critical measure of financial performance.
- Total Quantity of Orders: Captures the volume of denim items sold, offering insights into demand levels across the product line.
- Unique Customers: Reflects the number of unique customers who made a single order.

**Dimensions for Analysis**

- Product Category: Analysing sales by category (Pants vs. Jackets) helps identify trends and performance gaps, guiding product mix and marketing strategies.
- Product Name: A detailed breakdown of sales by specific product names allows for targeted marketing efforts, trend insights and product development adjustments.
- Loyalty Card: Sales data segmented by loyalty card holders versus non-holders helps gauge customer loyalty and assess the effectiveness of the loyalty programme for denim products.
- Date: This allows for assessing seasonality and sales trends over time, informing inventory and promotions management.
- Country: Sales performance segmented by country offers insights into regional demand. Understanding country-specific preferences can help tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to maximise regional revenue potential.
